# Formal Languages ​​and Computability

## Abstract
This repository contains exercise codes for the Formal Languages ​​and Computability discipline carried out in the JFLAP system.

## Goals
- **Computacional models**: Deepen knowledge of computing theory and understand the mathematical foundations that support computational models.
- **Explore Chomsky's Hierarchy**: Analyzing the classification of formal languages ​​and their applications in computing.
- **Finite automata**: Study and implement finite automata, Turing machines, and formal grammars, modeling computational processes and languages.
- **Limits of computation**: Develop skills in analyzing decidability and complexity, identifying the limits of computation and intractable problems.
- **Processing system**: Apply concepts from formal languages ​​and automata to compilers, pattern recognition, and natural language processing systems.

## Languages and Tools
- **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**: Some environments such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and JFlap were used to facilitate visualization.
